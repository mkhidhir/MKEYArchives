LIVE DB DE SAMPLE: Creating a Fleet by Beneficial Owner and Matching Live Position Data


Context 
We need a developer-focused example showing how to:

Define a fleet for a specific player (beneficial owner), e.g., CMA CGM GROUP.

Integrate and match that fleet’s vessel information with live position data.

Analyze the fleet’s historical performance over the last 6 months (e.g., speed, location).

This sample will serve as a reference for other beneficial owners who want to track their fleets in a similar fashion.

Acceptance Criteria
Fleet Creation and Management : Demonstrate how to identify CMA CGM GROUP’s vessels

Live Position Integration: Illustrate how to join or match the newly created fleet with real-time position data (e.g., lat/long, timestamp, speed).

Historical Analysis: Show how to retrieve historical positions (e.g., last few months) for the vessels in this fleet.

Summarize or visualize trends in speed and location over time (e.g., region heatmaps, average speed charts) in a beautiful dashboard where I want to see on a map : vessel position , on a heat map: vessel history activity, and on a table the average speed of these vessel over the last 6 months
