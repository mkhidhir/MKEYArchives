Linking /trades with /compliance APIs


Context
We aim to demonstrate how customers can use API v2 to connect data across different endpoints, creating a seamless integration of trade and compliance information. 

The /trades endpoint provides comprehensive details on commodity trades, while the /compliance API offers compliance data, including sanctions,  and risk assessments. 

Acceptance Criteria
Identify and solve a real-world challenge where combining trade data with compliance data enhances decision-making.

Develop a Python script that connects data from the /trades and /compliance APIs.

Provide clear documentation within the code to ensure readability and clarity on how the linkage is established between trade data and compliance information.

Create visualizations to showcase insights derived from the linked data. Potential visuals could include:
