Business Case for Understanding Vessel Ownership on Live DB


Context:

 We aim to create a business case focused on vessel ownership for the Hapag Lloyd fleet. The goal is to build and analyze this fleet using data from the Last Positions table in the Live DB to understand the different degrees of ownership and gain a comprehensive view of what this fleet is doing.

Objectives:
Build the Fleet: Use the Hapag Lloyd fleet from the Hapag Lloyd Vessels Page to construct the fleet in the database.

Analyze Degrees of Ownership: Identify and categorize vessels based on different levels of ownership, from full ownership to partial or shared ownership.

Fleet Activity Overview: Utilize the Last Positions table to gain insights into fleet activities, such as location, recent movements, and any anomalies.

Deliverables:
SQL and Python Code: Share the SQL and Python scripts used for building the fleet and performing the analysis within Snowflake.

Visualization: Provide a clear visualization of the results to demonstrate the analysis findings. This could include:

Maps showing fleet movements and current locations.

Charts indicating ownership distribution and activity trends.

Acceptance Criteria:
The business case should include a structured write-up detailing the analysis.

SQL and Python code used should be documented and explained

Visualizations should be included and includes: a map showing fleet movements and current locations and that  indicating ownership distribution
