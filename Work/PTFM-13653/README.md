Prevail Partners - R&C + Live Positions templates


Use Case:
A country wants to monitor vessels associated with dark activities as they enter its waters and receive notifications when this happens. This requires integrating:

Risk & Compliance API (to identify grey/sanctioned vessels)

Vessel Positions API with Custom Areas (to track when these vessels enter predefined zones)

Key Requirements:

The list of dark vessels is dynamic and will change over time.

The Custom Areas API needs to continuously update and monitor these new vessels in real time.

Notifications should be triggered when a listed vessel enters the country’s waters.

Questions:

Can the Custom Areas API dynamically update its monitored vessels based on an evolving risk list? If so, what’s the best approach?

How frequently can the vessel list be updated, and is there a limitation on the number of vessels we can track within a custom area?

What’s the best way to integrate the two APIs (Risk & Compliance + Vessel Positions) to ensure real-time alerting?

Are there any constraints or challenges we should consider for this setup?
